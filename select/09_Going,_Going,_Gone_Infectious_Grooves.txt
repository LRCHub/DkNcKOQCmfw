I'll take the sunshine, you can take the rain
I'll take some happiness and you can take the pain
I'll take the ladder and you can take the fall
And if there's more bad news this time you take the call

Going, going, happy going, sunshine going

I can't forget you no matter how I try
I'll think about you until the day I die
It could get better, but I know it will get worse
I wonder what it's like to be riding in a hearse

Going, going, happy going, sunshine going
Sunshine, going, going, gone
Sunshine, going, going, gone
Sunshine, going, going, gone
Going, going, gone

I got a song to sing you, can't get it out my head
It keeps on getting louder, can't get it out my head
I want to make it stop but can't get it out my head
I got to make it stop or I'm gonna lose my head

Going
Going

I got a though that's burning, burning inside my head
Can't put it out with water, burning inside my head

Going, going, happy going, going, gone
Sunshine going, going, gone
Going, going, gone

I've got to think of sunshine it's freezing in my head
I try to think of goodness, there's no thoughts in my head

Going, going, going, going
Sunshine, going, going, gone
Sunshine, going, going, gone
Sunshine, going, going, gone

You take it faster, but I wanna try it slow
Call it the good times, but I don't really think so
Some people will tell you, it doesn't hurt to try
But I've already done it, and I proved it's a lie
