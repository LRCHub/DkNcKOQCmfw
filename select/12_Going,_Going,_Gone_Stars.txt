Going, going, going, going... Gone

Still hooked on cellophane
Hanging 'round the mall and all
Each penny numbs the pain
Sends you gently for the fall
I followed you last night
I saw you turn your lights out
I knew it wasn't right
I watched in fear and doubt
It's gotten to be that way
(Going, going, gone)
What did you do today
(Going, going, gone)

Look good in that red dress
I bet the boyfriend's happy
Your face is scarred with age
You're twenty three
But how can that be
You're still hooked on cellophane
Killing time with gin and lime
Each second numbs the pain
Love's just another rhyme
It's gotten to be that way
(Going, going, gone)
I'm scared but I'm okay
(Going, going, gone)

There's nowhere to move on
There's nowhere to move on
All I see again
All I see
All I see again
All I see
All I see again
All I see
All I see again
Is me everywhere
It's me...

Dah da dah da do dut dah
Dah da dah da do dut dah
Dah da dah da do dut dah
Dah da dah da do dut dah
