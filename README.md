Lipstick message
on my bathroom mirror
Said: By the time you read this
I'll be west coast bound.
I'm cooked I guess she
couldn't get any clearer
No I was nothing but the
weight on her shoulders
I was holding her down
She left no trace on this
side of town no good-bye kiss
No "see you around"
I'm still right here both
feet on the ground
wondering where you are now...
Like is it a bird, is it a plane
or is it an angel taking
my heart away because the second
I know what I wanted
She's going,she's going,
she's gone
Was she ever here
was she ever mind
was she just a shooting star
burning up in the night
I could have given her all that
I got but I let her go and she's
going,she's going,she's going
she's gone
Oh,what a way to discover that
we're no good for each other
woke up alone in these covers
I guess I'm just another sucker
I went to sleep she left a key
took everything except for me
she left no trace on this side
of town no good-bye kiss
no "see you around"
I'm still right here both
feet on the ground
wondering where you are now...
Like is it a bird, is it a plane
or is it an angel taking my
heart away because the second
I know what I wanted or
She's going,she's going,
she's gone
Was she ever here
was she ever mind
was she just a shooting star
burning up in the night
I could give it all I got
but I let her go and she's going
she's going, she's going,
she's gone
Now she's the best
I’ll ever get and now I sleep
With my regret I watch her leave
and scream about the sky like
is it a bird, Is it a plane
or is it an angel taking
my heart away? because
the second I know what
I wanted or She's going,
she's going,
she's gone
Was she ever here
was she ever mind
was she just a shooting star
burning up in the night
I could have given it all I got
but I let her go and she's going
she's going, she's going,
she's gone
